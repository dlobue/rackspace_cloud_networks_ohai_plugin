This ohai plugin allows you to get to a machine's network info (ip, mac
address, etc) on the interfaces attached to your Rackspace Cloud server using
the name of the network rather than the the arbitrarily assigned eth* interface
name.


To give an example, say you create 3 cloud networks and attach them to your
cloud server through the Rackspace control panel. You will now have an eth2,
eth3, and eth4. Which is which? eth2 will be the first network you attached and
eth4 is the network you most recently attached. You could try and make sure you
always attach the interfaces in the same order every time, but this is fragile
and could easily break since you are able to detach and reattach networks to
your cloud server at any time.


Or what if you have 2 cloud networks, db and queue for example. Some servers
only have the db network attached, and others only have the queue network
attached. Reasoning around when eth2 is on the db network and when it is on the
queue network can get very messy very quickly.


Luckily Rackspace attaches a label to each interface on your server accessible
via metadata. So we can use this instead:

	{
	  "rackspace": {
	    "cloud_networks": {
	      "db": {
		"broadcast": "192.168.6.255",
		"mac": "XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX",
		"netmask": "255.255.255.0",
		"ip": "192.168.6.1"
	      },
	      "queue": {
		"broadcast": "192.168.6.255",
		"mac": "XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX",
		"netmask": "255.255.255.0",
		"ip": "192.168.6.1"
	      },
	      "private": {
		"broadcast": "10.1.1.255",
		"mac": "XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX",
		"netmask": "255.255.192.0",
		"ip": "10.1.1.2"
	      },
	      "public": {
		"broadcast": "1.2.3.255",
		"mac": "XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX",
		"netmask": "255.255.255.0",
		"ip": "1.2.3.4"
	      }
	    }
	  }
	}



Installation:
Just copy the plugin into your ohai plugin directory. If the version of ohai on
your system is >=7.0.0 use the version found in the v7 directory. Otherwise use
the version in pre-v7 directory.
